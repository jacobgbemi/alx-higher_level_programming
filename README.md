# HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAMMING

This repository contains programs written for Higher Level Programming track in the [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) program. In these projects, I worked through string manipulation in Pyhton, looping and control flow, list comprehension, dictionary, sets and tuples.  I learned how to apply these knowledge to solve practical problems. Below are the lists other basic concepts in Python that I practically engaged with.

### Acknowledgement
All works in the project were completed in regard to ALX online program (Cohort 6). The program offered a peer-learning platform where the participants undergo a rigorous project-based coding exercises, and learn by interacting with one another. More info is here: [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)
